# Reminder

This is not a to-do app, which outside of distributed development I rarely find useful. The best to-do app is pen and paper.

I'm bad at remembering all the bureaucratic parts of my life that I need to do every quarter, year or decade. They usually have something to do with tax, my house or my car and if I forget them I'll either be fined or shamed with some official finger wagging.

Tired of this happening, I wrote this to see if it would make me better at adulting. Unlike a to-do it doesn't track whether tasks are completed, it will just list things that are coming up or have recently passed using a simple plain text configuration. Hence "reminders", which I can request or setup to have a short summary appear at login.

For most people it would make a lot more sense to use a calendar, but I wanted something very simple, command line based with local storage and that did just one thing.
